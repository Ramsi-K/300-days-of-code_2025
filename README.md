# 300 Days Of Code - Year 2 üöÄ

Welcome back to my coding journey!

This repository marks the second year of my 300 Days of Code challenge.

Last year focused heavily on daily logs and updates within the realm of vision technologies. This year, the focus shifts towards deeper dives into key bootcamps and substantial projects, moving away from daily standup-style logging.

The goal remains consistent: dedicated coding effort. However, the definition of a "minimum viable day" is now centered on completing the LeetCode daily challenge. This ensures consistent problem-solving practice while allowing for more flexibility to concentrate on larger learning modules and projects.

_This repo links out to submodules and folders containing detailed work and documentation._

## üéØ Current Focus

> **Quarter 2 (July) 2025:** Execution-heavy sprint focused on cloud networking, agents, and LLM engineering.

Projects in motion:

- Networking Fundamentals Bootcamp
- Hypermode Agents Bootcamp
- LLM Zoomcamp
- Discord MCP Bot + 100DaysOfCloud infra

‚Üí See [Projects in Progress](#-projects-in-progress) for details

## Challenge Structure

- **LeetCode**: Daily challenges (code in `/leetcode/`, certificates in `/certs/leetcode/`)
- **Bootcamps**: Each bootcamp tracked as a submodule
- **Projects**: Larger projects get their own folders
- **Milestones**: Progress logged via sprint highlights & project completions, not daily standups

### Strategic Learning Phases

Instead of tracking 365 individual days, I'm organizing the year into strategic learning phases:

| Phase | Focus Area     | Timeline | Key Projects/Goals                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Generative AI  | Jan-Apr  | Completed GenAI Bootcamp                                                                                                              |
| 2     | MCP + Agents   | May‚ÄìJul  | AWS AIF cert, Networking Bootcamp, HuggingFace Hackathon, LLM Zoomcamp, 100DaysOfCloud Discord Bot, Discord MCP Server, Anthropic MCP |
| 3     | Cloud? A2A ACP | Aug-Oct  | 100DaysOfCloud, AWS SAA, Korean B2 (KSI)prep                                                                                          |
| 4     | [TBD]          | Nov-Dec  |                                                                                                                                       |
